Cryptography secures communication by creating protocols preventing people from accessing private information. SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) is a hash function that takes input and produces a message digest. Hash functions map data of different sizes to a fixed value. Hash functions take a key as an input and use it for data storage and retrieval.  

I was the lead designer for this project in replicating a simple SHA-1 hash function using C++. I did this project through ICS 212 at Kapiolani community college. jGRASP was the main framework used in this project. However, I decided to expand my frameworks for this class used JetBrainsâ€™ CLion. This was the first time I had used a framework outside of jGRASP, and it significantly improved my programming experience. Understanding different languages and their uses have helped me become a better programmer. This was also my first experience with cryptography. Data confidentiality is vital to understand when moving into the future of programming and skill development.
