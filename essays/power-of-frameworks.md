## Skip The Slow Stuff

When it comes to HTML there are many powerful frameworks that can improve efficiency while coding in order to streamline the process. The major drawback to learning UI frameworks is that they can be as complicated as learning a new language. However, the initial difficulty of the learning process gives ease to more powerful development down the road. One of these UI frameworks that I have learned recently is Boostrap 5. Bootstrap 5 is a library that simplifies the development of webpages by allowing the user to make many CSS choices directly in their HTML code. Learning a new framework such as Bootstrap can be challenging but the rewards are far superior to the struggles of learning the interface. Compared to HTML, coding with Bootstrap has allowed me to make much more complex and visually appealing websites with less work.

## Code Faster With Bootstrap

Bootstrap 5 allows programmers to implement different interface elements, “such as dialog boxes, tooltips, progress bars, navigation drop-downs, and carousels(wiki).” Bootstrap implements containers that are used to place elements inside. This allows a fluid layout of elements on the page without using CSS. Since beginning to develop in HTML I have found these components to be powerful. I have gone from building mediocre HTML pages and spending hours to perfecting the spacing of elements and lining them up on the page. With UI frameworks like Bootstrap, I have been able to build more complex and advanced websites in under an hour. Throughout my coding career, I hope to become more familiar with other frameworks so that I can improve my coding skills.
