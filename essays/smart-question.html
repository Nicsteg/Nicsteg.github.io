<h2 id="where-do-i-start">Where Do I Start?</h2>
<p>Throughout our careers, we face challenging questions in programming that require us to search the web for answers. Finding the correct forum and researching before asking a question can help streamline the process and receive appropriate responses. In “How To Ask Questions The Smart Way” by Eric Raymond, he outlines the importance of researching and understanding the proper way to ask a “smart” question. Many times users will post on forums without searching for prior knowledge and will be greeted with responses such as, “did you read the manual or search the web?”. Raymond’s article outlines the process of finding an appropriate forum, searching to see if your question has a solution, and asking the “smart” question when appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>This reflection will examine the difference between a “smart” and a “not-so-smart” question. One of the many forums people use to answer difficult programming questions is StackOverflow. In one example of a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34529557/angular2-typescript-increment-a-number-after-timeout-in-appcomponent.">“smart”</a> question, the developer states they want to create an Angular2 application using TypeScript. The developer has researched the topic and has a specific question about their code. They are concise with their question and site which application they are using to code. They also give an outline of their code and the problem stating, “when I use this code I am getting following error.” This question allows people to examine the issues and devise a solution. The question also outlines different solutions that they have tried. Being able to describe the problem specific to your code while giving examples of the problem is an excellent way to receive help. Also, these problems are not easily found by just “googling it.” Answers easily found by searching the web or “googling it” are often described as “bad” questions because they lack research. These questions include, “where can I find out stuff about the x, y, or z?” An example of a “not smart” can be along the lines of <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74591978/is-microcode-and-machine-code-the-same-thing/74602563#74602563.">“is microcode and machine code the same thing?”</a> This topic is about a beginner learning a new subject. Most of what is asked could be researched through their class text or “googling it.”</p>

<h2 id="i-am-ready-to-ask-a-smart-question">I Am Ready To Ask A “Smart Question”</h2>
<p>Efficiently finding answers to difficult coding questions is a skill that can help improve work efficiency and learning. Most questions on forums and online have answers, and a quick search of your question on websites like StackOverflow can give powerful results. Instead of spending time creating a question, waiting for a response, and ultimately asking something that has an answer can be a waste of time. Now when I run into difficulty, I can research, search for answers, and ultimately ask the right questions when posting online.</p>
