## Dev's Cookbooks

Design patterns are solutions to common problems that arise during development. Design patterns streamline the development process by providing proven solutions to recurring issues. Having design patterns helps create readable code that can help prevent problems with future development by decreasing errors and increasing scalability. Conventionally, there are three overarching design patterns: creational, structural, and behavioral. Design patterns can be compared to recipes for cooking. Recipes describe step-by-step methods for preparing a meal. By following the cooking recipe, one can create a consistent and pleasing dish. Following a design pattern can help with the development process by creating consistent and readable code. 

## Recipe for Success

 For our final project in ICS 314, our team had to design a website that could be used by the University of Hawaii at Manoa community. For this project, we used a meteor-react template to design a website. Meteor offers different designs and architectural patterns that developers can use to help build websites. These patterns helped my team stay organized and maintain code to obtain good performance and user experience. Just as a cook follows a recipe to create a meal, we use a pre-designed template to build a website. Using these templates allows us to make an efficient website by using pre-defined design patterns and structures. This would be like a cook modifying a recipe to fit their customer's dietary restrictions and tastes. This allowed us to streamline the coding process and build unique features and functionality for our project for the community to use.
